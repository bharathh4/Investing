Yield curve is a plot of bond maturity date vs yield of bonds of similar risk

You can have 

  normal curve: 
    short term yield is low and long term yield is high.
    In this scenario, economic expanision is expected. People expect demand for bonds to not rise in
    the long term, thus parking their money in short term equities or stock and not in long term bonds.
    When demands for long term bonds falls, the price of long term bonds fall, thus their yield will be higher. Why?
    Because people can buy these for a low cost and reap huge returns when the bonds mature.
    
   flat curve:
    short term yield and long term yield is the same
    
   inverted curve:
    short term yield is high and long term yield is low
    In this scenario, recession is expected. People expect demand for long term bonds to rise. So they start buying up 
    bonds. So long term bonds become expensive. So when you buy these at a high cost, your yield at maturity is low. 
    So instead of investing in the stock market people buy bonds. So stocks could fall or stay low like in a recession.
