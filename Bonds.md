Some lessons from Investing history:
- Bonds are not always safe:
    - In a pandemic scenario, if interest rates are cut to near zero:
        - Short-term bond yields will be low, making them less safe in terms of generating income. However, they are generally safer for preserving capital, as they are less affected by interest rate fluctuations.
        - Long-term bonds might offer higher yields, appearing safer for income generation, but they carry higher risk in terms of capital preservation due to potential interest rate hikes.
    - If the Federal Reserve (or other central banks) raises interest rates:
        - The value of existing long-term bonds will decrease, making them less safe for capital preservation. Their higher yields become less advantageous due to increased interest rate risk.
        - Newly issued short-term bonds in this scenario might offer higher yields than before and are generally safer for preserving capital due to their lower sensitivity to interest rate changes.
    - Overall, long-term bonds are less safe in terms of preserving capital when facing interest rate hikes.
    - Short-term bonds are less safe in terms of generating income during periods of low-interest rates but are generally better for preserving capital.
