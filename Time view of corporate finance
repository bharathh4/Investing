1. The Investment decision: Among many tasks what should I spend my time on so that I would have maximum time saved and returned to us in the future. Best ROI in time. Can I work 1 hour today so that I/others get back 2 hours of freetime everyday. If I save any time, I will reivest that in doing tasks that will save us more time. 

2. The Financing decision (leverage): If I don't have enough time, can I borrow time. Can I ask someone for their time and promise them my time with some interest time in the future. Borrow well if borrowing is cheap and if the prospects of saving time is huge. Sometimes borrowing is cheap. Sometimes it is even free (say a computer program doing your stuff)

3. The Dividend decision: If I cannot deploy the time I have saved for myself to further save time for us, I should give away my current time doing stuff for others so that people can use their saved time working on stuff that will further save them time.

Notes:

If money gets in the way, assign a reasonable hourly pay for yourself and others and convert interchangeably. Money can be a great proxy for time.

What is wealthy/rich in the time version. You having all the time available to you (18 hours a day) and you are happy and people have no expectation from you. Even if people have expectaions from you and you are happy about it, then time spent on the expected task is not a personal time loss. But the fact that people have expectations means that there some collective time loss. If you are not happy about it, then it is time loss.
